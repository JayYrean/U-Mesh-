The dataset is prepared specifically for U-Mesh+. 

Due to confidentiality constraints, we only release a preprocessed LoS-based connectivity dataset derived strictly from the parameter settings described in the paper. 

In this dataset, fromIdx and toIdx denote the start and end nodes of each link, respectively, and the link type is encoded using 0/1, where 0 represents an omnidirectional link and 1 represents a directional LoS link.
